    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h6>
        <p>Hello! I'm Kristine, a cadet member of the GDG Web Development Team. I am 21 years old, and a 3rd year student at PUP-Taguig taking BSIT. <br>
        I joined this team mainly because I want to improve my skills in JavaScript and other frameworks. I also wanted to be a part of a thriving community <br>
        that focuses on skill improvement. I'm excited to work with you all! <br>
        </p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <h6>
        <p>For hobbies, I enjoy doing pilates for exercise. I also read a ton of books, and I'm currently finishing an R.F. Kuang novel titled "Babel". <br>
            Aside from this, I also enjoy watching a few mainstream anime such as One Piece and Attack on Titan. I also love <br>
            coffee hopping and trying out new local bistros and restaurants. 
        </p>
